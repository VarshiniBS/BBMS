  Blood Bank Management System is an application designed to handle the daily transactions of the blood bank and search the details when required. It also helps to register the details of donors, blood collection details, blood test reports as well as blood issued reports. 
  I have used python tkinter module for front end design and mysql for the database.

To run the application please do the following:
  1. Install the tkcalendar package using pip install command.
  2. Download and unzip the project folder.
  3. Create a new database in mysql.
  4. Enter the user,password and database name into the python files wherever mentioned.
  5. Run the CreateTables.py file which creates the necessary tables and adds an entry for the admin.The login Id and password for admin can be changed in CreateTables.py file. The default admin login id and password is
       login Id : root
       password : welcome
  7. Run the sql files for stored procedures and triggers.
